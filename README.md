## JavaScript Raycasting Engine
A simple raycasting engine built with JavaScript, using the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm, completed as part of the [Pikuma Raycasting Engine Progamming](https://pikuma.com/courses/raycasting-engine-tutorial-algorithm-javascript) course.

This project takes inspiration from the techniques used in Wolfenstein 3D to deliver a pseudo 3D effect in a 2D game world.

## Project Status
This project is a quick proof-of-concept to serve as an introduction to the Raycasting techniques used in Wolfenstein 3D.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser

## Controls
Use WASD to move the player.

## Future Improvements
The current approach uses angles to represent orientation. It could be worthwhile to refactor the engine to use vectors instead, similar to the approach outlined in [Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html).
